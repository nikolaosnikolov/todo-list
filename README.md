# todo-list
## What is this project?
This project is one of the most important projects that I have made with React. The styling is made by me, and no styling framework such as Bootstrap has been used. In this project there is an input in which you can add some Todos that you want to complete. If you have completed a Todo you can just click the close button and this Todo will be disappeared. All React sources that I am using are inside index.html file, and they are required for the project to work.
## How to run this project?
To run this project you have to take the code and put it on your editor (I am using vscode). Then, you can either run it with Live Server or to run your personal http-server. If you want to see only the result, you can just visit https://nikolaosnikolov.github.io/todo-list/
